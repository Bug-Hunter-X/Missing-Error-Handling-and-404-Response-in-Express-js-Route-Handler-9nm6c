# Missing Error Handling and 404 Response in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input and an absence of proper 404 responses.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The original code lacks error handling for cases where the user ID is not a number or when a user with the specified ID does not exist.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  Additionally, it does not return a standard 404 Not Found response when a user isn't found.

## Solution

The solution includes robust error handling. It checks if the user ID is a number and if a user with that ID exists.  If not, it sends an appropriate 404 status code along with a descriptive message.  This ensures better user experience and application stability.
